### Pirate101 and Gameforge is currently not supported!

Do not use this for any purpose other than to make the game more enjoyable for
you and remember that **this could get you banned**.

Current Features:
- Hotkeys (RegisterHotKey issues will be fixed with next release)
- System tray menu
- Teleport to quest (with controllable offset)
- Multibox support (should have no limit on active clients)
- Dynamic clients (you can open and close games anytime)
- Single instance
- ~~Pirate101 and Wizard101 support~~
- ~~Gameforge support for Wizard101~~

Hotkeys:
- Alt+Q: Teleport to quest.
- Alt+E: Teleport to quest, offset in *current direction.*
- Alt+R: Reset offset.
- Alt+F: Increase offset.
- Alt+C: Decrease offset.
- Alt+X: Raise movement speed.
- Alt+Z: Lower movement speed.

I uploaded it in an encrypted zip archive to prevent any possible issues downloading. If you share this with anyone, please send them this archive.

Future Plans:
- Fix RegisterHotKey error (conflicts with other programs; no good solution)
- Remove the need for offset teleports (hopefully)
- Improve movement speed hack to update on zone change (requires too much work to the current code)
- Add Pirate101 support again (it's messy to support both x86 and x64)
